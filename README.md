# A Christian Agnostic

This is the source code for my (Chris Anthony's) personal blog.

## Setup

Follow the instructions at https://gohugo.io/ to install Hugo.

## Common commands

### Run the web server locally

With drafts (pages marked with `draft = true`) enabled:

```
hugo server --buildDrafts
```

Without drafts:

```
hugo server
```

The command will print a URL that can be used to view the webpage.  Saving a source file will update the rendered web page.
